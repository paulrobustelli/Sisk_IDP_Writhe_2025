We overview the code to reproduce the results from the manscript in jupyter notebooks, which can be found in the results folder. 


The raw data pertaining to our results is available at: LINK TO DATA REPOSITORY

This includes precomputed writhe features, tCCA decompositions, Kmeans clusters estimated over a range of parameters, MSM results for all 6 systems.

Accompanying this project is a python software package distibuted hosted on Python Package Index, PyPI : https://pypi.org/project/writhe-tools/.

The package can be installed via:

```bash
pip install writhe-tools
```
